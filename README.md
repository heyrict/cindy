Cindy
=====
A (non-)replica project for replicating the
website of [sui-hei.net](sui-hei.net) by `Django`.

The name of `Cindy` stands for **Cindy Is Not Dead Yet**,
which comes from the popular original character of
[Cindy](http://sui-hei.net/app/webroot/pukiwiki/index.php?%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3).

**THE PROJECT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. WE URGE FOR YOUR SUPPORT!**
